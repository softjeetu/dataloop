The Exercise

Build a Pythonic data model class `Data` with the following requirements:

1. loads a dictionary and can save to dictionary: `to_dict`, `from_dict`
2. ability to instantiate directly from the class
3. default value: can define a default value for attributes
4. autocomplete
5. dynamic and general usability for the class (easily define new data structures)
6. ability to reflect inner value on the main level
